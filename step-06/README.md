# Polymer Beers - Polymer tutorial - Step 06

Enough of building an app with five beers in a hard-coded dataset! Let's fetch a larger dataset from our server using one of [Polymer iron elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=iron-elements) called [`iron-ajax`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-ajax).

## Data ##

Our new dataset is now a list of 11 beers stored in JSON format in the `step-05/beers/beers.json` file in your project. You need to put the file into `app/beers/beers.json` to make it available from the server at the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/beers/beers.json`.

`app/beers/beers.json`:

```json
[
  ...
  {
    "alcohol": 6.8,
    "description": "A reddish-brown abbey ale brewed with dark malts. The secondary fermentation gives a fruity aroma and a unique spicy character with a distinctive aftertaste. Secondary fermentation in the bottle.",
    "id": "AffligemDubbel",
    "img": "beers/img/AffligemDubbel.jpg",
    "name": "Affligem Dubbel"
  },
  ...
]
```

## `iron-ajax` element

We will use the `iron-ajax` to  to make an HTTP request to your web server to fetch the data in the `app/beers/beers.json` file. 

`iron-ajax` is one of the elements in the [Polymer iron elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=iron-elements) collection, a set of visual and non-visual utility elements. They include elements for working with layout, user input, selection, and scaffolding apps.

`iron-ajax` makes an HTTP GET request to our web server, asking for `beers/beers.json` (the url is relative to our `index.html` file). The server responds by providing the data in the JSON file. (The response might just as well have been dynamically generated by a backend server. To the browser and our app they both look the same. For the sake of simplicity we used a JSON file in this tutorial.)
